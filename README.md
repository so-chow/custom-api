#RECIPE BOOK API DOCUMENTATION ### By: Sophia Chow

Welcome to my Recipe Book API! Here you will find documentation you need to start creating, retrieving,
updating, and deleting recipes in your recipe book.

##About My Recipe Book API: The API built on REST principals keeps track of current recipes and any
recipes you'd like to add. You can first, create your own recipe book with your own name, name of book,
and an array of your recipes. Each time you add a recipe, it will add to your collection of recipes in
your recipe book! You can even create separate recipe books if you want to categorize your recipes. In the
future, I'd like to make a way for you to search and organize your recipes through your tags.
